Repository contains two jupyter notebook files. Each method in Phase I must be run before Phase II. 
The included CSV file is necessary for Phase I to run and must be in the same directory location as Phase I.
Phase II summary methods must be run before any of the insight methods. 
Summary methods rely on files produced from running Phase I; both .ipynb files must be in the same directory folder.
